Welcome to the **5-Day RTL Design and Synthesis Workshop**. This repository contains all the labs, source code, and documentation for a hands-on learning series focused on Verilog RTL design, simulation, synthesis, and digital circuit optimization using open-source EDA tools and the SKY130 PDK.

## 🎯 About This Workshop

This workshop is designed for students and engineers who want to gain practical experience in the complete RTL-to-GDSII flow. The key learning objectives include:

- **Verilog RTL Design**: Writing clean, synthesizable Verilog code for digital circuits.
- **Simulation & Verification**: Creating testbenches and analyzing waveforms using Icarus Verilog and GTKWave.
- **Logic Synthesis**: Converting RTL code into a gate-level netlist using Yosys.
- **Open-Source PDKs**: Working with the SKY130 Process Design Kit for synthesis.
- **Core Digital Design Concepts**: Understanding timing libraries, synthesis strategies (flat vs. hierarchical), efficient coding styles, and handling synthesis-simulation mismatches.
- **Optimization**: Applying combinational and sequential optimization techniques to improve circuit performance.
